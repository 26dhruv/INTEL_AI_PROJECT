# Redirects for Single Page Application (SPA) routing
# This file tells Render to serve index.html for all non-API routes
# so React Router can handle client-side routing

# API routes should be proxied to backend (if needed)
/api/*  /api/:splat  200

# All other routes should serve the main index.html file
# so React Router can handle them client-side
/*  /index.html  200
